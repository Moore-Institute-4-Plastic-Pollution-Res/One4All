## Document Overview

This document outlines a workflow to utilize the validator app from the Microplastics Data Portal. After reading this document, users will have a better understanding of the processes involved in creating this app and how to use it. The purpose of this tool is to not only validate data, but to share data as well, promoting open-source resources. For more documentation about the One4All R package, please see the [One4All Package Tutorial](package.html).

## Background: Rules

This section discusses how the app validates and shares data. First and foremost, there is an existing set of rules created in excel that is applied to the app prior to user usage. These rules allow the app to verify the validity of a user's data once they've uploaded it in the app. The rules sheet consists of multiple columns, including a name, description, dataset, valid example, severity, and the rule itself (see below for more details).

**Name:** The name of the row. `'(ex. Amount)'`

**Description:** A description of the rule itself and its requirements. `'(ex. If there are two or more identical particles (in every aspect), upload it once and indicate the number of identical particles here as a whole number)'`

**Dataset:** Labeled 'particles', 'methodology', or 'samples'. `'(ex. partices)'`

**Valid_example:** A valid example of the rule. `'(ex. 2)'`

**Severity:** The severity of the rule, labeled either a 'warning' or an 'error'. Warnings will still allow the data to be shared, whereas an error will need to be restructured. `'(ex. warning)'`

**Rule:** The rule itself that the validator app reads to validate data (written in r code). `'(ex. Amount >= 2 | is.na(Amount))'`

Under the `'_Help'` tab within the app, there is a sample rules sheet for users to download and view.

## Running the App

To access the validator app, go to our [GitHub](https://github.com/Moore-Institute-4-Plastic-Pollution-Res/One4All.git) and link it directly to your own device in R studio. After setting up the github to your device, go to the validator folder and select the global.R, ui.R, or server.R. From here, select the command `'Run App'` which will then display the app.

## How to structure your data

Download the valid example data under the `'_Help'` tab within the app. To properly structure your data follow the example by creating three sheets: one for methodology, samples, and particles. Copy the columns from the valid example into each of these sheets. Each column corresponds to one of the rules from the rule sheet, so refer back to the sample rules for the requirements. Although it is necessary for all columns to be labeled, the validator app encompasses a wide variety of data, so it is not a requirement for all of the columns to be filled. The columns that you don't fill out can be left blank.

```

## Sharing Data

Once the app is open, upload your data by selecting the 'Upload Data' tab. Your local folder tab will then be displayed where you can select from your csv or xlsx files along with the corresponding zip file. Acceptable data formats are csv, xlsx, and zip files. Once the files have been selected, click open and a screen will appear with the option to share your uploaded data. If this is an update to a previous submission, select that tab and upload the previous certificate from your local device. However, if this is a new submission, then follow the rest of the prompt on the screen. 

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("appimages/UploadDataValidator.png")
```

An input key is optional and should only be provided if required. If it is required it will have been provided to you from us ahead of time. Following this, if your data was successfully uploaded, a new display, `'Successful Remote Data Sharing'`, will appear. If the data was not successfully uploaded, a display will appear marking which columns need to be reevaluated. The `'Validating Data'` section below provides instructions on how to correct invalid data.

```{r, fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("appimages/SuccessValidator.png")
```

## Validating Data

If you simply want to validate your data, select cancel on the `'Would you like to share your uploaded data'` screen. Your data should now be displayed among three boxes- methodology, samples, and particles. Each of these tables automatically display the number of successes, warnings, and errors in your data. To further view the details, click on a table which will display two boxes, `'Issues Raised'` and `'Issues Selected'`. If there are any errors or warnings, those columns will be highlighted in yellow or red, respectively in the 'Issues Raised' box. To view all statuses, including successes, switch the tool toggle labeled `'Errors only?'` to off. The description of each rule and its status (success/warning/error) are defined for the user to identify what rule was violated. By clicking on one of the highlighted boxes, the data entries that need to be fixed from that column will then be displayed and highlighted in the 'Issues Selected' box.
